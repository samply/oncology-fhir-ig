# Oncology FHIR® Implementation Guide
The project defines the FHIR profiles of the onclogy data model of the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and the Comprehensive Cancer Centres in Germany.
The data model comprises three categories of information : 
* Patient-identifying data, 
* Medical/ clinical data and 
* [Biosamples][4]

The clinical data include the primary diagnosis, treatments and the subsequent follow-ups. The data model allows biosample data to be recorded dependent or independent of the primary diagnosis.
